  <h2>Reading response two</h2>
  <p>Vannevar Bush’s ‘As We May Think’ brought up a very powerful point to me, that while humanity has been able to speed up efficiency and raise productivity due to the emergence of new tools and technologies, we may be overwhelmed with resources. Obviously the replacement of human workers with computer automation frees us up to spent less time on mind numbing, repetitive tasks. Yet that computer automation could also end up taking all of people’s jobs, leaving us as senile and lazy as the humans in ‘Wall-E.’ Bush states that the key for humanities’ evolution is using these new technologies to push our minds. My concern is that there’s such an infinite database of information on the internet that people may be overwhelmed, and choose to use none of it. We have these libraries of information on our phones, yet most people use those phones for banal posts on social media, or video game apps. Not saying there’s anything wrong with social media or games, just that the plethora of information may be daunting to those who dont have a direct purpose or reason to sift through that database. Hopefully, the internet motivates people to learn more about the world, rather than fall into lethargia. ‘Long live the web’ by Tim Burners Lee has a very interesting take on the future of the web. He speaks on how there is an immense amount of information being pushed onto the web every second, yet the computers are currently unable to process and interact with the data as humans would. This leaves deep corners of the web with obscure information that may get lost in overflow. While this data processing could be tainted by things like DeepFake or false reports tricking the technology, as we develop computers to be able to process this information with nuance, the possibilites are endless.</p>
