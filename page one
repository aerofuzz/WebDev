       <h1> Welcome to my site</h1>
        <p class="p-welcome">John berger really enlightened me to how we subconsciously percieve art differently due to what context we view it in. Some may percieve a painting as fine art when framed in a museum, while the same painting may be devalued if its sold by a street vendor outside the museum. Most people just see content as content, yet the packaging and presentation immensely affects someones appreciation. Exactly the reason why even though some phones may have better tech than the iPhones, a majority of people still turn to Apple because of the brand image and the packaging when opening the product. While we may not consciously see and analyse these other aspects, they undoubtedly affect our perceptions. I’m not sure I agree with Berger’s statement that digital reproduction ruins or devalues the art itself, however. While the details of a sculpture or painting may be lost when viewed online versus irl, its better than the artwork is able to be seen by a broader audience, than be limited to one place in the world. It could even raise more appreciation and inspire someone to travel to the original artworks location.

While the emergence of digital reproduction may have some downsides, the benefit of free information and the omnipresence of the internet outweigh the slight quality change. I hope to work in the fusion of digital and analog, shooting videos on film and displaying them in an online forum, or animating a design to be displayed in a real life forum. With the internet providing access to both, we’re in an age with more creative tools at our disposal than ever.</p>
